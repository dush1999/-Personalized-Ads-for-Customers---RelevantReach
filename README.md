# -Personalized-Ads-for-Customers---RelevantReach
 
The main theme of this project was to generate advertisements in a more useful and efficient way, ensuring they are relatable to customers and not futile. This two-way benefit allows companies to better understand their customers' needs and save resources by delivering only relevant ads. 


Data Prediction: We utilized S-ARIMA for time series forecasting to predict customer spending patterns, allowing us to tailor advertisements accordingly.

Data Collection Challenges: One of the most significant challenges was accessing personal spending data, as it is private. We addressed this by having individuals fill out forms to provide their data. 

Future Plans for Data Collection: To further enhance data collection, we proposed an innovative idea where customers could earn points by submitting photos of their bills, encouraging participation and ensuring a steady flow of spending data.

Recognition: This project was awarded "Best Content" in two hackathons, highlighting its innovative approach to advertising optimization.
